## Introduction <span id="introduction"></span>

### Origin <span id="origin"></span>

In an era of flourishing information technology, rapid development in big data and artificial intelligence, and increasingly strict information-security and risk-management requirements, public agencies face rising demands in information-system development and maintenance. These systems must improve internal administrative and operational efficiency while providing the public with more convenient digital services. At the same time, public-sector IT teams often face limited staffing and slower technological innovation. Against this backdrop, open-source software and Public Code offer new possibilities for change.

Open-source software is a development and licensing model contrasted with proprietary software. In common software-system procurement, an agency defines its business needs, selects a product or tool that already provides the core functions, asks a vendor to customize and deploy it, and pays through buy-out, licensing, or subscription models. After go-live, the agency usually obtains only the right to use the system.

Under the proprietary-software model, the source code is not public, licensing is provided by the original vendor, and agencies typically continue relying on that vendor for maintenance services, which also raises switching costs.

| Type | Source Code | Licensing and Support | User Rights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Proprietary software | Not public | Licensing provided by the original vendor | Right to use |
| Open-source software | Publicly available | Technical support may come from vendors, communities, or multiple providers | Ownership and reuse flexibility |

The core feature of open-source software is that its source code is publicly available and allows others to use, copy, modify, distribute, and share the technology. Procurement of open-source software systems focuses on establishing collaborative relationships among developers, vendors, and communities. Through this model, agencies can obtain technical support, integration services, and long-term maintenance capabilities while reducing licensing costs, avoiding vendor lock-in, improving technical autonomy and flexibility, and accelerating innovation through global community resources.

At the same time, Public Code echoes the spirit of open-source software. Originating in Europe and later expanding in countries such as the United States and Canada, Public Code follows the principle of “public money, public code.” It encourages the public sector to release source code developed or procured with public budgets under open-source licenses. Public Code can be understood as the public sector’s open-source software repository. It allows agencies with similar needs to reuse existing work, reduces duplicated manpower, budget, and time, and enables the public to inspect the quality of digital services. When services involve the public interest, transparent Public Code helps people understand how systems operate, builds trust, strengthens civic participation, and reinforces national digital infrastructure.

Therefore, the Ministry of Digital Affairs prepared this manual to help agencies understand open-source software and Public Code. The manual assists information-planning personnel in establishing management measures and standards for open-source software, and helps project owners, IT developers, and maintenance teams understand methods for adopting open-source software. In doing so, agencies can respond to international digital-development trends and gradually expand the use of open-source software.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Open-Source Software <span id="chapter-1-introduction-to-open-source-software"></span>

### 1.1 How it started <span id="1-1-how-it-started"></span>

From the 1950s to the 1970s, computers were not yet as popular as they are today and nearly all software was written and developed by academic researchers. It was pretty common for computer users to openly share the source code of the software they used to other users and hardware manufacturers. Because of this, knowledge sharing happened very naturally and it also contributed to the rapid evolution of information technology back then. When the early UNIX systems were released in the 1970s, their source code was also released along with them. However, by the late 1960s and early 1970s, as the software functions needed to accompany hardware became more sophisticated, development costs increased accordingly. To prevent software costs from driving up hardware costs, vendors gradually separated software and hardware releases. With the commercialization of software, along with the involvement of patent and copyright systems, many companies began closing off and “protecting” their source code, prohibiting users from freely modifying or distributing it.

In 1983, Richard Stallman[^1] initiated the GNU[^2] project, inspired by the challenges he personally encountered regarding the inability to freely share software while working at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT (MIT AI Lab). At the MIT AI Lab, there was a Xerox printer that frequently jammed or had printing issues. Stallman’s habit when encountering such problems was to directly modify the driver’s source code to add a notification function, allowing users to receive warnings whenever a paper jam occurred.

However, the new driver for this Xerox printer was provided by an external company, with its source code not publicly available. Therefore, Stallman could no longer modify the program as he used to in order to solve the problem. He even approached the vendor to request the source code but was rejected. It was a significant blow to him because the tradition at the AI Lab was that everyone would solve problems and help each other through sharing source code.

To Stallman, vendors refusing to provide access to the source code represented the collapse of a culture of community collaboration. He believed this would isolate programmers from one another, even turning them into “enemies,” since everyone would be forced to guard their own proprietary programs instead of helping one another. For this reason, he believed that accepting proprietary software licenses would be equivalent to endorsing the notion that “not sharing” is acceptable, which contradicted his values of “freedom” and “cooperation.” As a result, he made a drastic decision: to develop a completely free operating system himself so that people would not have to rely on closed source software.

In September 1983, Stallman formally announced the GNU Project on an online newsgroup. His goal was to build a “completely free and Unix-compatible operating system.”

He founded the Free Software Foundation and at the same time promoted the Four Essential Freedoms of “Free Software” and the GNU General Public License (abbreviated as GPL or GNU GPL), thereby safeguarding the rights to freely share and modify software.

The Four Freedoms of Free Software can be summarized as follows:

| Freedom | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Freedom 0 | The freedom to run the program for any purpose. |
| Freedom 1 | The freedom to study how the program works and change it to meet your needs. |
| Freedom 2 | The freedom to redistribute copies to help others. |
| Freedom 3 | The freedom to distribute modified versions so the whole community can benefit. |

Open-sourced software (OSS) originated from Eric Raymond[^3]’ essay “The Cathedral and the Bazaar[^4]” in 1997. This essay discussed the two development models: The Cathedral Model and the Bazaar Model and Eric Raymond believed that the Bazaar Model will result in better development quality since “given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”

The essay contrasts two development models:

| Model | Development Style | Source Code and Release Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bazaar model | Open and distributed development | Source code is open to public participation, with frequent releases and rapid iteration. |
| Cathedral model | Closed and centralized development | Source code is maintained by a dedicated developer group, with slower releases and greater emphasis on order. |

![Red church icon representing the cathedral model, where a dedicated team centrally manages development with slower releases](assets/en-image8.png "Cathedral model: centralized software development")

![Bazaar model illustration representing open distributed development, public participation, rapid fixes, and frequent releases](assets/en-image7.jpeg "Bazaar model: open collaboration and rapid iteration")

This essay was also responsible for inspiring Netscape’s decision to release its “Netscape Communicator” as free software in 1998, which was developed via public collaboration. Netscape Communicator eventually evolved into popular software such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird[^5]. As Netscape announced to make its browser’s source code open source, a group of community leaders began to discuss how to make it easier for the business community to accept this software model and introduce the concept and benefits of free software by Free Software Foundation to the commercial software industry. Thanks to the rapid development of the Linux operating system and the Internet in the 90s, many software projects thrived with public collaboration.

However, there were several challenges when conveying the concept of “free software” to the public:

- “Free” is easily misunderstood as “free of charge” instead of “freedom to use.”
- The narrative has a strong ethical and political framing, which some businesses worry may be perceived as “anti-business.”

Therefore, Eric Raymond, among others, proposed the term “open-source” and established the Open-Source Initiative (OSI), which is responsible for promoting and certifying licensing agreements that meet the “Open-Source Definition” (OSD)[^6].

Software with “open-source licensing agreement” that meets OSI’s definition can be called “open-source software”. The key is that software with publicly available source code does not make it open-source software. It must meet certain conditions with specific licensing agreement to be considered genuinely open-source software.

To make things easier to understand, we generally call free software and open-source software as “free and open-source software” (FOSS) or “free/libre and open-source software” (FLOSS). These two names can prevent confusion while emphasizing the core values shared by both.

The Open-Source Definition (OSD) can be summarized in ten requirements:

| Requirement | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Free distribution | The software may be sold or given away without requiring a license fee. |
| Source code | The program must include source code and allow distribution in both source-code and compiled forms. |
| Derived works | The license must allow modifications, derived works, and redistribution. |
| Integrity of the author’s source code | The license may require modified versions to be distributed as patch files, but it must still allow distribution of software built from modified source code. |
| No discrimination against persons or groups | The license must not exclude any person or group. |
| No discrimination against fields of endeavor | The license must not restrict use in specific fields such as business or research. |
| Distribution of license | Redistribution must not require an additional license agreement. |
| License not specific to a product | Rights must remain in effect even when the software is separated from the original distribution. |
| License must not restrict other software | The license must not require other software on the same medium to also be open source. |
| Technology-neutral | The license must not depend on a specific technology or interface. |

In terms of technical applications, whether in operating systems, the Internet, cloud services, or AI computing, the fundamental development, key frameworks, and tools in these fields are largely open-source projects.

Linux itself is the world’s mainstream server operating system and the Android operating system for mobile devices is also based on Linux. According to usage statistics provided by W3Techs in November 2025[^7], among identifiable server operating systems worldwide, the free software Linux accounts for 58.4%, while the proprietary Windows accounts for only 10%.

The same W3Techs report also indicates that among identifiable websites on the Internet, the open-source web servers Apache and Nginx together account for 58.2%, exceeding half. Front-end web technologies are dominated even more by open-source projects, such as the WebKit engine used by the Safari browser as well as commonly seen front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular, all of which are important examples of open-source projects.

In cloud services, Docker has already become an indispensable deployment tool. Its Docker Engine[^8] is a well-known open-source software project licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The core of cloud system management, Kubernetes[^9], is also under the same license and has been widely supported by major cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Finally, the foundation of AI computing services—deep-learning frameworks such as PyTorch[^10] and TensorFlow[^11] as well as tools used for training and research, such as NumPy[^12]—are all widely used open-source projects.

These examples fully demonstrate that modern digital development is fundamentally built upon free and open-source software.

### 1.2 International Trends and Applications <span id="1-2-international-trends-and-applications"></span>

This section includes three examples of government agencies adopting open-source software in other countries, which will help us understand the main trend of the adoption of open-source software among government agencies.

#### 1.2.1 German Federal Government Led the Development of openDesk <span id="1-2-1-german-federal-government-led-the-development-of-opendesk"></span>

![openDesk feature overview showing office collaboration, files, email, messaging, meetings, and project-management modules](assets/en-image9.png "openDesk feature overview")

*Image source: openDesk.eu*

ZenDiS (Zentrum Digitale Souveränität), fully named the Centre for Digital Sovereignty of the Public Administration, is an organization established by the German federal government in December 2022 to promote open source and strengthen technological autonomy and digital sovereignty in the public sector.

openDesk is one of ZenDiS’s flagship products, an office and collaboration platform composed of multiple free and open-source software components and designed for public-administration agencies. Its functions include word processing, spreadsheets, email, calendars, contacts, cloud storage, chat, video conferencing, project management modules, and Wiki[^13]. Initially, openDesk was developed under the Sovereign Workplace project led by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior (Bundesministerium des Innern, BMI), and it was fully transferred to ZenDiS for further development and management in early 2024.

openDesk was not developed from scratch. Instead, it integrates multiple mature open-source software projects already used in enterprise and public-sector contexts, and provides a unified interface and user experience. This approach supports rapid deployment, controls maintenance costs, and reduces duplicated development and resource waste.

openDesk is more than a collaboration tool. It is part of Germany’s digital sovereignty policy and has the following implications:

- Reduce vendor lock-in: When government agencies over-rely on a single commercial software provider, especially a major foreign vendor, they lose control over data access, maintenance, upgrades, privacy, and oversight. openDesk adopts open source and open standards to emphasize interoperability and replaceability.
- Enhance transparency and security: The source code can be inspected, which helps agencies identify vulnerabilities or backdoors and makes third-party review easier.
- Unify and standardize workflows: A unified collaboration platform reduces the operational burden, training cost, and maintenance cost caused by scattered tools, while improving administrative efficiency and interdepartmental collaboration.
- Support policy and legal goals: The promotion of openDesk echoes the German government’s digital strategy, IT-Planungsrat[^14], and Digital Sovereignty policy, which encourage government agencies to adopt open-source software to preserve autonomy and flexibility.

#### 1.2.2 UN Proposes “Digital Public Goods” <span id="1-2-2-un-proposes-digital-public-goods"></span>

In addition to the “Public Money, Public Code” initiative promoted by the general public, the United Nations, in its “Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation” published in 2020, officially proposed the concept of “Digital Public Goods.”

Digital public goods include open data, open-source software, open content, open standards and open artificial intelligence models. UN believes that digital public goods can unleash the potential of digital technologies and data and promote its global Sustainable Development Goals. The UN will formulate relevant standards as new digital public goods become available so that they can be adopted in real life.

Many countries have incorporated similar mindset in their policies. For example, government in the Europe, North America and Australia are implementing policies encouraging the adoption of open-source software or the publishing of the government’s development results in open source, in line with the spirit of “public code.”

The five Digital Public Goods in the UN’s “Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation” are:

- Open data
- Open-source software
- Open content
- Open standards
- Open artificial intelligence models

![Diagram of the five digital public goods in the UN roadmap: open data, open-source software, open content, open standards, and open artificial intelligence](assets/en-image12.png "Five digital public goods in the UN roadmap")

#### 1.2.3 The US’ Federal Source Code Policy <span id="1-2-3-the-us-federal-source-code-policy"></span>

Even though Europe’s digital sovereignty movement has everything to do with multiple measures by the US in recent years, the US itself, it turns out, has also been promoting public code-related policies for years.

In 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Executive Office of the President of the United States (EOP) proposed the Federal Source Code Policy in a form of memorandum. The policy’s primary goal is to support the sharing and re-use of the custom-developed source codes procured between different government agencies and support the public access to the certain source codes.

Federal Acquisition Regulation is the main source for IT service acquisition regulation related to public code. This Regulation was formulated jointly by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council (DARC) under the General Services Administration (GSA), with the goal to set a common standard for the principles and procedures for the federal government’s acquisition.

### 1.3 Basic Concept and Licensing Agreement Types of Open-Source Software <span id="1-3-basic-concept-and-licensing-agreement-types-of-open-source-software"></span>

Open-source software’s licensing agreement mainly specifies how the software can be used, modified and distributed. It ensures that the rights of the original developers are respected while promoting the sharing and reuse of source code. Different types of licenses also determine whether modified source code must be made public or whether the same license must be used. In Section [1.1](#1-1-how-it-started), we mentioned that the Open-Source Initiative (OSI) is the organization responsible for promoting and certifying licenses that comply with the Open-Source Definition (OSD). Only software released under OSI-approved licenses may be called open-source software.

The OSI website lists more than 120 OSI-approved licenses! Clearly, with so many types of licenses, developers who do not fully understand the differences will inevitably have great difficulty choosing the appropriate one. As a result, websites such as “Choose an Open-Source License” have emerged to help developers select suitable licenses. We will begin by introducing the six common licenses mentioned on that website.

#### 1.3.1 GPL：AGPL、GPL、LGPL <span id="1-3-1-gpl-agpl-gpl-lgpl"></span>

The GPL family can be understood by the strength of its copyleft obligations:

| License | Copyleft Strength | Core Obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AGPL | Strongest | Web services using AGPL-licensed source code must publish the complete corresponding source code. |
| GPL | Strong | Modified or integrated GPL source code must be released under the same license when distributed. |
| LGPL | Weaker | Files that only use LGPL-licensed code through a library interface generally do not require the entire project to be open sourced. |

![GPL-family copyright-protection strength diagram comparing LGPL, GPL, and AGPL from permissive to strong obligations](assets/en-image13.png "GPL-family copyright-protection strength")

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is the strictest copyleft[^15] license with the strongest protection. However, after years of evolution, 3 GPL variants appeared in response to the different computer and Internet environment. They are: AGPL (the strongest), GPL (the standard) and LGPL (the weaker license).

In GPL V3, it requires that “complete source code (including covered works and modified versions of the source code, which also include larger works using that covered works) must be provided under the same license. The copyright and license agreements must stipulate that the author(s) have explicitly granted the patent.” Simply put, in a GPL-licensed project, any modification or integration of the source code to a new project, it must be open-source under GPL license. The only exception is when it is treated as an external tool or standard interface without integrating the source code, then the project can maintain the original license.

#### 1.3.2 Mozilla Public License (MPL) v2 <span id="1-3-2-mozilla-public-license-mpl-v2"></span>

In contrast to GPL, MPL is a “weak copyleft” and only applies per-file. In other words, once you modify MPL-licensed files, you must make public the file’s source code. However, if you only put MPL-licensed files with other proprietary files in the same project, other files do not have to become open-source. Unlike GPL, MPL does not “infect” the entire project. MPL only requires that “modified files” to continue to comply

with MPL. MPL aims to encourage business utilization and feedback while maintaining its flexibility. One of the best example is Mozilla Firefox,which allows businesses to modify Firefox without worrying that the entire product need to comply with GPL.

#### 1.3.3 Apache License v2 <span id="1-3-3-apache-license-v2"></span>

Apache License is a type of “permissive license.” It only requires that copyright and license agreement be included and that contributors explicitly grant patent rights (meaning that if someone contributes source code, they cannot later sue others for using that code based on a “patent.” This is intended to protect users and developers).

But licensed works, their modified versions, and larger works containing them can all be released under different licenses without the requirement to publish the source code. It can be said that Apache License has “no copyleft concept at all.” Users may freely modify, redistribute, and even integrate Apache-licensed source code into proprietary software without having to release the modified or complete project source code. Its goal is to maximize adoption, enabling anyone (including private businesses) to use it freely. For example: Hadoop[^16], Spark[^17] and Kubernetes[^18]—large-scale infrastructure software—almost all use Apache v2 because it allows enterprises to adopt and invest resources in their projects confidently.

#### 1.3.4 MIT License <span id="1-3-4-mit-license"></span>

MIT is a short and simple permissive license agreement. Its only term is that the copyright notice and permission notice must be included. Under this condition, licensed works, modified versions of source code and larger project containing such works can be published under different licenses without making public the source code. The MIT License is used comprehensively (including Node.js[^19] and Ruby on Rails[^20]).

#### 1.3.5 Boost Software License 1.0 <span id="1-3-5-boost-software-license-1-0"></span>

Boost Software License 1.0 is a simple and permissive license, similar to MIT but even more permissive. Its only term is that the copyright notice and license text must be included when distributing the source code (does not apply to the edited binary file). Covered works, modified version of the software (including larger project containing such works) can be published under different licenses without publishing the source code. Boost Software License 1.0 is commonly used in the C++ community, mainly the Boost Library[^21].

#### 1.3.6 The Unlicense <span id="1-3-6-the-unlicense"></span>

As the name suggests, this is a “license” with no conditions whatsoever which dedicates works to the public domain. Therefore, unlicensed

works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without license notice or source code. Users do not even have to credit the original author as the author completely gives up their copyright under this license.

The six licenses introduced above can also be placed on a spectrum from strict copyleft to permissive licensing:

| License Type | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| AGPL / GPL / LGPL | The GPL family requires corresponding open-source release under the same license when its copyleft conditions are triggered. |
| MPL v2 | If an MPL-licensed file is modified, the source code of that file must be made public. |
| Apache License v2 | Requires copyright and license notices, and contributors explicitly grant patent rights. |
| MIT License | Requires copyright and license notices when distributing the source code. |
| Boost Software License 1.0 | Requires copyright and license text when distributing source code, but not when distributing compiled binaries. |
| The Unlicense | Waives copyright and releases the work into the public domain. |

![Open-source license spectrum diagram ranking GPL, MPL v2, Apache License v2, MIT License, Boost Software License 1.0, and The Unlicense by copyright-protection strength](assets/en-image14.png "Open-source license copyright-protection spectrum")

### 1.4 Open-Source Software and Public Code <span id="1-4-open-source-software-and-public-code"></span>

Summarizing each subsection of Chapter One, open-source software refers to software whose source code is publicly available and allows others to use, copy, modify, distribute, and share the technology. Such software enhances system security and controllability. For the public sector, it is an important tool for promoting digital governance and information autonomy.

When the public sector uses open-source software to develop information systems, it also lays the foundation for developing Public Code. The core mission of the public sector is to promote the public interest, and the software and systems it develops, procures or leases are established for the benefit of the public; therefore, public interest should naturally come first. “Public Code” refers to information systems—or portions of their source code—developed using public funds and made publicly available by the government or public sector, allowing society to freely access and reuse them, thereby enhancing policy transparency and civic participation. Through the promotion of Public Code, the government can facilitate cross-agency collaboration, accelerate innovation in digital services and build a more open and trusted digital environment.

## Chapter 2: Open-Source Software Application Evaluation <span id="chapter-2-open-source-software-application-evaluation"></span>

### 2.1 Difference Between Using Open-Source and Proprietary Software <span id="2-1-difference-between-using-open-source-and-proprietary-software"></span>

In the planning process of implementing an information system, choosing between open-source software and proprietary software is often a crucial decision faced by information officers. The two differ significantly in financial cost, security management, implementation methods and license management. Understanding these differences helps agencies better understand the characteristics of open-source software and make the best choice based on actual needs.

It is important to note that open-source software and proprietary software are not always two mutually exclusive categories. From the perspective of license management, some software may adopt a “dual licensing” model. Dual licensing is a software licensing strategy that allows the same software to be offered under two different licenses:

one is an open-source license, usually allowing free use, modification and distribution; the other is a commercial license, providing additional advanced features, technical support or exemptions from open-source obligations for enterprises or specific use cases. This model allows developers to balance community contribution and commercial profit, while allowing users to choose the licensing approach that best fits their needs.

In summary, both open-source software and proprietary software have their respective usage scenarios and risk considerations. When planning system implementation, information officers should comprehensively evaluate the agency’s technical capabilities, budget, resources, customization needs and long-term maintenance strategies before choosing the solution that best aligns with business goals and information-governance principles.

The main differences between proprietary and open-source software are as follows:

| Dimension | Item | Proprietary Software | Open-Source Software |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Financial cost | Software and service costs | Software licensing fees and technical support fees. | Mainly technical service costs. |
| Security management | Source-code transparency | Source code is not public and is maintained by the vendor. | Source code is usually public and can be reviewed by communities and the public. |
| Security management | Vulnerability patching | Security checks and patches are scheduled by the vendor. | Community oversight is strong and updates are frequent; agencies must monitor community activity and establish maintenance processes. |
| Implementation model | Supplier collaboration | Usually involves one vendor, such as the original vendor or an authorized distributor. | A project may work with one or multiple vendors, with fewer restrictions on vendor selection. |
| Implementation model | System integration | Integration and customization depend on the product’s API or protocol. | Open standards are commonly used, providing greater integration flexibility. |
| License management | License model | Proprietary licenses restrict the scope of use. | Open licenses allow modification and redistribution. |
| License management | Use restrictions | Protected by copyright law and licensing contracts, usually prohibiting reverse engineering. | A single system may involve multiple open-source licenses and requires license-compatibility review. |

### 2.2 Open-Source Software Benefits and Risks Analysis <span id="2-2-open-source-software-benefits-and-risks-analysis"></span>

In Section [2.1](#2-1-difference-between-using-open-source-and-proprietary-software), we have comprehensively compared the differences between proprietary and open-source software in many aspects. In this section, we will summarize the benefits and the potential risks of open-source software to help agencies fully grasp the advantages and what to look for when introducing open-source software. This will help them make the best choices that best meet their needs and are suitable for their information environment.

#### 2.2.1 Open-Source Software Benefits <span id="2-2-1-open-source-software-benefits"></span>

When the public sector uses open-source software for information-system development, it is not only practicing open and transparent digital governance; it also gains clear benefits in cost, security, customization, system integration, vendor choice, and policy value.

| Benefit | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Policy and public value | Choosing open source is both a technical choice and a policy statement: digital tools should serve the public interest, improve transparency and auditability, and strengthen public trust. |
| Predictable financial cost | Open-source software has no licensing fees, and agencies retain fairer bargaining power over future maintenance fees. |
| Vendor flexibility | Agencies are not locked into a designated vendor and may choose local or international providers, reducing vendor-lock-in risk and encouraging industry development. |
| Security-management autonomy | Public source code helps agencies understand and control systems; communities and third parties can identify and fix vulnerabilities earlier. |
| System integration | Open-source software often adopts standard protocols and formats, making it easier to integrate with existing systems and support cross-platform collaboration. |
| Customization | Agencies may modify functions, expand modules, and optimize interfaces according to business processes. |

#### 2.2.2 Risk Analysis of Open-Source Software <span id="2-2-2-risk-analysis-of-open-source-software"></span>

Even though open-source software offers significant benefits, agencies should still conduct a complete risk assessment for selected items during information-system adoption. The risk-assessment process can be integrated with existing risk-management activities, including:

- (1) Collect risk issues that may be involved in open-source software currently used or planned for adoption;

- (2) Score each risk issue according to its likelihood and impact;

- (3) Prepare response measures for risk issues whose scores exceed the acceptable risk value.

Common risks include:

![Line illustration of a person holding a workflow diagram and document, representing transition and vendor-maintenance risks in open-source adoption](assets/en-image16.png "Open-source software risk illustration")

| Risk | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transition risk | Migrating from proprietary software to open-source software may require substantial manpower and time for data migration, process redesign, system validation, and staff training. |
| Vendor quality and maintenance responsibility | Open-source projects may rely on community support; public-sector systems still require reliable development and maintenance teams, clear responsibility, and stable vendor quality. |
| Information-security risk | Agencies must establish security monitoring and patching mechanisms so systems are not exposed to known vulnerabilities. |
| Licensing and legal risk | Open-source licenses such as GPL, MIT, and Apache are legally binding. Agencies should review license compatibility and consult legal advisors when necessary. |
| User acceptance | Staff may be accustomed to proprietary tools such as Microsoft Office or Google Workspace; training and cultural change remain essential. |

### 2.3 Open-Source Software Implementation Model <span id="2-3-open-source-software-implementation-model"></span>

When implementing open-source software, there are three different strategic pathways available, including: (1) directly adopting existing open-source solutions; (2) identifying the current requirements during preliminary research and forming a new solution by integrating multiple open-source software; or (3) building the system entirely in-house from scratch and then considering subsequent release arrangements due to special requirements. All three approaches and respective considerations will be further introduced in this section.

#### 2.3.1 Development Strategy: Adopt, integrate or self-build? <span id="2-3-1-development-strategy-adopt-integrate-or-self-build"></span>

When the public sector uses open-source software for information-system development, it should choose an implementation strategy according to project needs, internal capacity, and long-term governance requirements.

1. Adopt: When project requirements can be clearly mapped to mature open-source software, directly adopting the existing solution is efficient and relatively low risk. This approach can reduce implementation time and duplicated development, reuse global community experience, adopt open specifications and standards, and reduce maintenance challenges through public source code and community resources.
2. Integrate: This approach combines multiple open-source projects, such as frameworks, libraries, or data platforms, to form a flexible solution that meets local needs. Germany’s openDesk is an example: it integrates multiple existing open-source services into a sovereign office suite for German public agencies.
3. Self-build: For special requirements or critical and sovereign systems, agencies may need to build systems in-house to ensure legal compatibility, long-term maintenance flexibility, national-security requirements, digital sovereignty, or control over core government services.

Regardless of the strategy, successful open-source adoption depends on an “Open First” approach. Openness should be treated as a design principle from the beginning. Agencies should assume future open-source release early in the project and prepare the architecture, license management, and documentation accordingly. Components should remain closed only when necessary for security, privacy, or unreleased policy reasons. For layered design, agencies may refer to the UK government guideline “Security Considerations When Coding in the Open”[^23], which reminds us that “security should be designed into openness, not into secrecy.”

![Open First security governance diagram centered on openness, with key and credential separation, automated scanning and review, and responsible vulnerability reporting](assets/en-image32.png "Open First security governance")

#### 2.3.2 Explore Projects and Referenceable Platform <span id="2-3-2-explore-projects-and-referenceable-platform"></span>

During the assessment and preliminary research prior to system adoption, agencies or vendors may first look for existing projects that can be reused or adapted. However, searching directly through public code repositories such as GitHub or GitLab is like looking for a needle in a haystack. The following are several renowned Public Code platforms:

| Platform | Operator | Features | Representative Projects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Software Index openCode.de | Germany’s Centre for Digital Sovereignty (ZenDiS) | Focuses on digital sovereignty and EU compliance, with an emphasis on reuse and sustainable maintenance. | openDesk, FIM (Federated Information Management), Smart Village App. |
| SILL database code.gouv.fr | France’s Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM) | Integrates free software adopted and maintained by ministries. | LiiBRE, OpenFisca, GeoNature. |
| Digital Public Goods Registry | Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA), jointly maintained by UNICEF, UNDP, and Norad | Focuses on open-source software that promotes the SDGs; each project must pass open-source, ethical, governance, and transparency review. | DHIS2, OpenCRVS, U-Report. |
| Public Code Platform Code.gov.tw | Ministry of Digital Affairs (MoDA), Taiwan | Integrates open-source projects and APIs, and promotes interdepartmental collaboration and open governance. | Data Safe Transfer Verification System, Standard Address Writing API, CodeFest Taipei website. |

When evaluating whether to adopt an existing open-source project, agencies are advised to focus on actual needs, development capacity and governance requirements as the core criteria, rather than relying solely on regional or language differences. After forking, many open-source projects can often meet local requirements through integration and customization while retaining the operational strength of their global communities. For example, Germany’s OpenDesk, based on Nextcloud[^24], was re-integrated into a version that complies with German public-administration security and privacy regulations. Such reuse is not merely a technical extension but also a governance strategy: while maintaining a shared code base, institutional management ensures continued access to community support and maintenance. Similarly, OS2 borgerPC (Citizen PC Workstation), launched by Denmark’s OS2 Alliance[^25] (Offentligt Software Samarbejde), was localized and renamed Medborgare (meaning “citizen”) when adopted in Sweden. While the original OS2 architecture and maintenance processes were preserved, a Sweden-specific localization model was also developed.

The localization of open-source projects demonstrates the continuity and shareability of Public Code across cultures and communities. Taking Taiwan’s recent transition from the National Development Council to the Ministry of Digital Affairs as an example, a forked application of LibreOffice was adopted and further developed into a government-wide common service: the ODF Document Application Tool. This improved version added standardized Taiwanese official-document formats and commonly used functions. Although localized, civil servants can still refer to the original international LibreOffice community documentation and training resources while benefiting in practice from localized naming, functions, and support.

### 2.4 Open-Source Software Governance System <span id="2-4-open-source-software-governance-system"></span>

The development process for adopting open-source software is no different from that of general software engineering as both include stages such as requirements analysis, design, implementation and testing. The biggest difference lies in the fact that open-source software is connected to a global and continuously evolving collaborative community behind it. When introducing open-source software, an agency should avoid the mindset that this means using free software. Instead, it should focus on how to systematically and strategically incorporate this dynamic open-source ecosystem into the development process. Without a clear internal project governance strategy, it is easy to fall into security, licensing and operational risks or even trigger public-relation crises for the agency.

#### 2.4.1 Open-Source Software Governance System <span id="2-4-1-open-source-software-governance-system"></span>

Taiwan’s public sector has long collaborated with external vendors for system development. However, most project teams have yet to establish a comprehensive strategic framework for the use and governance of open-source components. As a result, both agencies and the public find it difficult to clearly understand actual maintenance responsibilities and accountability while agencies struggling to verify the origins and security of open-source components. The core objective of this section is to assist agencies in utilizing various open-source resources within a scope that is “controllable, visible, and traceable,” and to establish clear open-source governance practices. This ensures that system operations and maintenance are no longer merely outsourced tasks but rather public digital infrastructure that can be truly understood, managed and confidently sustained over the long term.

Establishing a complete strategy and mindset for open-source governance is what is referred to here as an “Open-Source Software Policy.” Such a policy transforms “the use of open-source software” into “the practice of open thinking.” The “Open-Source Software Policy” described here does not rely on strict legislative procedures. Instead, it can begin by forming unified standards, strategies or shared understandings within a few specific projects, and then gradually evolve into an organization-wide strategy. This strategy should clearly articulate how to “explore, use, contribute to and release” open-source software. When agencies or individual projects lack a clear strategy for the use of open-source software, the following risks will gradually accumulate:

| Risk | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Supply-chain blind spots | If vendors do not disclose all open-source components, agencies cannot maintain a complete software bill of materials and may be unable to respond quickly when upstream vulnerabilities appear. |
| Version and maintenance risk | Different systems using different versions of the same open-source component may create long-term maintenance difficulty and internal conflicts. |
| Licensing risk | Open-source licenses are diverse; failure to comply with obligations under GPL, Apache, MIT, and other licenses may cause legal disputes or require source-code release. |

These issues are not merely technical challenges. More importantly, they require strategic governance to address the gaps in risk management. Only after an open-source software policy is formulated can risks be quantified, tracked and managed. The term “policy” here refers to such governance mechanisms and strategies and it also aligns with the Traditional Chinese translation used in international ISO standard documents, thereby facilitating future alignment with international standards and participation in international projects.

#### 2.4.2 Open-Source Software Policy and Software Bill of Materials <span id="2-4-2-open-source-software-policy-and-software-bill-of-materials"></span>

This section will discuss benchmark case studies in the practical implementation of open-source software policies and introduce supporting tools, including the management of Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), as well as the global rise of public-sector Open-Source Program Offices (OSPOs). These are provided to help agencies gradually strengthen their governance mechanisms by referencing the following:

##### Benchmark Case Study of the Implementation of Open-Source Software Policy

###### Case Study 1: KKCompany, the Model Company for Implementing Open-Source Policy in Taiwan

Taiwan-based media technology group KKCompany became the first enterprise to obtain third-party certification under OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230. With the assistance of the Open Culture Foundation (OCF), KKCompany integrated open-source compliance processes into its core business operations. Its motivation was to “empower educational developers” and to build a “trustworthy software supply chain.” This certification not only brought tangible benefits for the company’s operation—such as reducing errors and accelerating time to market—but also demonstrated to global partners KKCompany’s respect for intellectual property rights and commitment to the open-source ecosystem.

###### Case Study 2: Department of Homeland Security, the USA

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through its Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), serves as the national cyber defense authority. Its open-source policy framework places a strong emphasis on security and risk management, treating open-source software as a component of critical infrastructure and stressing the importance of continuous monitoring and protection.

###### Case Study 3: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), whose core mission is to provide public healthcare and health services, places greater emphasis in its open-source policy on enhancing transparency, promoting code reuse and collaborating with communities to improve public healthcare systems. CMS has also established a dedicated Open-Source Program Office (OSPO) and developed a series of reusable tools—such as repository templates and maturity models—that significantly lower the barrier to open-source adoption not only within its subordinate agencies but also accelerate the sharing of public code with partner organizations.

###### Case Study 4: Department of Information Technology, Taipei City Government

“Taipei City Pass” is the open-source version of the “Taipei Pass” service. The Department of Information Technology of the Taipei City Government collaborated with contracted vendors to preserve the full development history of the framework architecture, front-end code, and associated event websites and released them publicly on the “Public Code Platform” under the department’s name. In contract design, the department pre-defined governance rules for post-release open-source management, clearly specifying processes for bug reporting, fixes, pull requests (PRs), and version changes—ensuring that the code was not only “released,” but also continuously maintained. The website for the annual “CodeFest” is similarly built on publicly available source code, iteratively updated each year, and combined with hackathons and hands-on activities. Participants improve user experience on the website while also reporting and fixing real-world operational issues for Taipei City Pass. Although Taipei City is still in the process of establishing a unified and citywide open-source policy, its concrete implementation of open-source clauses and governance mechanisms through individual projects and vendor maintenance contracts has already demonstrated a viable “progressive open-source pathway,” gradually transforming citizen service portals into sustainable and evolving public digital assets.

##### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Management

Among all open-source governance practices, the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical management component and is recommended as one of the first management tools to be adopted. However, one key concept must be emphasized: producing the SBOM document itself is not the endpoint, but the starting point. The true value of an SBOM lies in the fact that it is a “dynamic and machine-readable” asset inventory that provides the foundational data for all subsequent automated security and compliance processes. If it is treated merely as a static document to be archived after delivery, its potential in modern software supply chain management will be completely untapped. Agencies may require vendors, during the procurement process, to provide corresponding follow-up actions for dynamic assessment and risk management based on the SBOM.

##### Core Features of SBOM

| Feature Aspect | Feature Details | Practical Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulnerability Management | Using automated to tools to continuously compare the components in SBOM with the database of known vulnerabilities (such as CVE) for early warning in time | Information security protection and vulnerability patching |
| Licensing Compliance | Programmatically analyze the license types and terms of all components in a project to ensure compliance with legal and policy requirements. | Open-source license management and compliance audit |
| Transparent Supply Chain | Build a clear and verifiable software dependency chart with a clear list of all software “components” | Software lifecycle tracking and risk control |

Currently, there are two mainstream SBOM formats in the industry. Organizations that focus on legal and procurement processes may prioritize adopting SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange), as it provides more precise descriptions of licensing. Development teams that center on DevSecOps and emphasize rapid iteration and risk responsiveness may consider using CycloneDX, which features a lightweight, security-oriented design. Mature organizations should ultimately be capable of handling both formats. For example, they may require suppliers to provide SBOMs in SPDX format within procurement contracts, while simultaneously generating and analyzing CycloneDX-format SBOMs automatically within internal continuous integration or continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, thereby achieving comprehensive governance coverage.

##### SPDX vs. CycloneDX Comparison

| Feature | SPDX | CycloneDX | Advice on Public Sector Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lead organization | Linux Foundation | OWASP Foundation | Both are internationally recognized authoritative standards. |
| Initial core | License compliance and legal details | Vulnerability management and information security application | The main format will be determined based on the agency’s priority (compliance or information security). |
| Main advantages | Detailed license terms and file-level information, widely adopted by the community. | A lightweight format designed specifically for automation that can clearly describe component dependencies and known vulnerabilities. | SPDX is recommended for procurement and legal audits; CycloneDX is recommended for DevSecOps. |
| Key fields | Detailed component, file, licensing and copyright information. | Components, services, dependencies and vulnerability exploitability exchange (VEX) | Based on the user scenario: Compliance requires SPDX’s licensing field; information security requires the vulnerability fields in CycloneDX. |
| Ecosystems and Tools | A mature ecosystem that supports multiple tools. | High integrability with information security scanning with a rapidly-growing ecosystem. | Both formats have the support of a wide variety of open-source and commercial tools. |
| Supported formats | JSON, XML, YAML, RDF, tag-value | JSON, XML. | Both support the mainstream and machine-readable formats with high integrability. |

##### The Global Emergence of OSPO at the Public Sector

Once open-source policies are gradually established, a role similar to an “Open-Source Program Office” (OSPO) can be created to coordinate open-source–related matters, execute internal policies, consolidate and provide open-source–related training resources, communicate with legal units and manage relationships with communities. In addition to enabling agencies to engage with open-source contributors, it also serves as a medium for interaction with the global open-source community. In recent years, the establishment of OSPOs in the public sector has become an international trend. To this end, a global network called FLOSS-PSO[^26] (Free/Libre and Open-Source Software Public Sector OSPOs) emerged in 2025. This network connects public-sector OSPOs around the world and provides a neutral platform for exchange, allowing members to share experiences, pool resources and initiate collaborative projects. Its members are shown in the figure below.

If agencies in Taiwan can consolidate their internal open-source strategies and establish their own OSPOs, they will have the opportunity to join this network, engage directly with global pioneers of digital governance, draw on valuable experience and bring Taiwan’s achievements in digital government onto the international stage.

*CC By 4.0 “FLOSS-PSO Community Map” Resource: OSPO Alliance*

#### 2.4.3 Introduction to International Open-Source Compliance Standards <span id="2-4-3-introduction-to-international-open-source-compliance-standards"></span>

As open-source policies or OSPOs are gradually established, to ensure rigor and credibility in the process of adopting open-source software, it is recommended that agencies further reference and adopt international standards when formulating a verifiable internal process.

OpenChain is an ISO/IEC international standard, is similar to other open-source policies or governance frameworks mentioned above in that it retains a high degree of flexibility and extensibility. Promoted by the Linux Foundation, its design philosophy focuses on defining “what should be done (what)” and “why it should be done (why),” rather than “how it must be executed.” This allows organizations to implement it flexibly according to their own contexts. OpenChain is applicable to organizations of different sizes: small entities can achieve compliance through simplified and semi-automated processes, while larger agencies can adopt integrated and automated toolchains. It also supports a “start small and scale up” approach—beginning with a single project or government department and gradually expanding to the entire organization, offering considerable implementation flexibility.

The OpenChain framework mainly consists of two international standards: ISO/IEC 5230 (focused on open-source license compliance processes) and ISO/IEC 18974 (focused on open-source security and supply-chain governance). Organizations are not required to adopt both simultaneously. Many countries require only adherence to the core principles in public procurement regulations, or mandate that contractors possess relevant certifications. Subsequent sections will introduce the content of these two standards respectively, as well as the certification adoption approaches that agencies may take.

##### Ensuring License Compliance: ISO/IEC 5230 (OpenChain License Compliance)

ISO/IEC 5230, an international standard for “license compliance” in open-source software, defines the core requirements that an open-source compliance program must meet. When an organization follows this standard, it signifies the establishment of a systematic approach to managing open-source licenses, thereby significantly reducing legal risks. Its core requirements, mapped to the software lifecycle, can be summarized into four key practice areas: Program Foundation, Management and Support, Process Implementation, and Community Engagement, as detailed in the table below.

###### Keys to the Implementation of ISO/IEC 5230

| Key | Sub-item | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Program Foundation | Policy formulation | Formulate an open-source policy in writing and make sure that related personnel clearly understand the policy |
| | Roles and responsibilities | Clearly define each role in the open-source compliance process (such as the developers, legal expert and project managers) and their responsibilities |
| | Education and training | Ensure that all parties involved are equipped with the knowledge and skills essential to the fulfillment of their responsibilities and that they understand the policy clearly |
| Management and Support | Resource allocation | Make sure that the department/staff (such as OSPO) in charge of open-source compliance have enough resources and budget |
| | Legal support | Must appoint legal experts with the expertise to handle internal/external open-source licensing issues |
| | External communication | Establish an open communication channel that allows any third party to inquire about license compliance issues |
| Process Implementation | Component tracking | Put in place a process for identifying, tracking and keeping record of all open-source components in the software. This is usually achieved by producing SBOM |
| | License review | Review the license agreement of each component to clarify the obligations, restrictions and rights |
| | Management of compliance documentation | Establish a process for generating, delivering and archiving all necessary compliance documentation, including license agreement and source code delivery notice |
| Community Engagement | Contribution policy | Formulate a clear policy regulating organization employees’ contribution behavior for external open-source projects. |

- ISO/IEC 5230 key documents: Complete license notices, attribution documents, and source-code offer where required.
- ISO/IEC 5230 target roles: Legal department, procurement department, software development team, and OSPO.

In public-sector applications, Italy’s Agency for Digital Transformation (Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale, AgID) has shifted from a fragmented and project-based procurement model to a collaborative ecosystem centered on open source and reuse. To avoid legal risks and barriers to reuse caused by licensing errors, AgID established an “open-source license decision tree” to assist government agencies in selecting the most appropriate license types during adoption, ensuring that software can be safely reused and shared.

At the same time, Italy’s renowned public IT consortium, CSI Piemonte (Consorzio per il Sistema Informativo del Piemonte), incorporated open-source compliance into its routine organizational processes to meet AgID’s stringent requirements and obtained OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 certification. As of 2025, it has successfully passed recertification four consecutive times. For CSI Piemonte, this certification has become a continuous and institutionalized mechanism to ensure that all projects are lawful, traceable and reusable. Italy’s experience demonstrates that only when open-source governance becomes a system rather than a project can Public Code truly become a shared digital asset for all citizens.

Another example from the United Kingdom is Interneuron, a company that provides critical healthcare software to the UK National Health Service (NHS) and other public healthcare systems, which has successfully adopted ISO/IEC 5230. This demonstrates that even in highly regulated and risk-averse domains such as healthcare, the process framework provided by this standard is sufficient to establish trust across the supply chain. For government agencies that must handle sensitive data and critical services, this standard is a highly-valuable benchmark.

##### OpenChain Security Protection: ISO/IEC 18974

Following license compliance, the OpenChain program further applied the same process-management philosophy to security and introduced the ISO/IEC 18974 standard. The core objective of this standard is to help organizations establish a systematic process for identifying, tracking and responding to known security vulnerabilities in the open-source software they use, such as vulnerabilities recorded in the CVE database.

The requirements of ISO/IEC 18974 correspond structurally to those of ISO/IEC 5230, together forming a comprehensive governance framework. Its key practice areas, mapped to the software development lifecycle as described in the table below:

###### ISO/IEC 18974 Key Practices

| Key | Sub-item | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Policy and Scope | Policy scope | Formulate an open-source “security protection policy” in writing with its applicable scope clearly defined |
| Threat and Vulnerability Management | Vulnerability detection | Establish a method to detect whether or not open-source components utilized have any known vulnerabilities. This is usually achieved with an automated tool that scans SBOM. |
| | Risk response | For known vulnerabilities that have been discovered, the organization must follow up by tracking and handling these vulnerabilities and verify that the risks have been mitigated before launching the program. |
| | Continued monitoring | There must be a method in place to continuously analyze if newly-published vulnerabilities have any impact on current products even after the software launch. |
| Incident Response and Communication | External reporting channel | Establish an open channel allowing third parties to report security vulnerabilities. |
| | Internal response process | Put in place an internal process that handles vulnerabilities reported from outside the organization. |
| | Client communication | There must be a method to send the information related to the vulnerability to impacted users or clients if necessary. |

- ISO/IEC 18974 key documents: Vulnerability list, risk evaluation report, patching schedule, and patching records.
- ISO/IEC 18974 target roles: Information security department, DevSecOps team, software development team, and OSPO.

ISO/IEC 5230 and ISO/IEC 18974 are complementary to each other. The former addresses “legal and compliance risks” by ensuring that organizations comply with the license terms of the open-source software they use, thereby reducing legal risks; the latter addresses “technical and security risks” by ensuring that organizations can effectively manage known security vulnerabilities in the open-source software they use, thereby reducing information-security risks. When an agency complies with both standards, it signifies that it has established a comprehensive and verifiable governance framework covering the major risk domains of open-source software.

##### Certification Pathway

Certified compliance with the standards above can be obtained via two pathways:

- Self-certification: OpenChain provides a free online self-certification checklist. Organizations can use it for internal audits and gap analysis to determine whether they meet the requirements.
- Third-party certification: Organizations can hire an accredited independent certification body to conduct an audit. Once they pass the audit, they receive an official conformance certificate. As shown in KKCompany’s example, this method provides a strong external endorsement of an organization’s open-source governance capacity and is important for building trust with clients, partners, and regulators.

Moving from policy formulation to the adoption of international standards is an essential path for transforming open-source software from a potential risk into a strategic advantage. Organizations can refer to appendix IV, “Self-Assessment Checklist for Public-Sector Project Adoption of Open-Source Software (or Public Code) Requirements Planning, while conducting self-assessment.

Institutional strategies can’t be built all at once. By gradually establishing a verifiable governance framework aligned with international best practices, Taiwan’s public sector can not only effectively manage risks but also enhance the quality and resilience of digital services while actively participating in global digital innovation and collaboration as a responsible and trustworthy partner.

## Chapter 3: Open-Source Software Implementation <span id="chapter-3-open-source-software-implementation"></span>

### 3.1 Software Development Process: Needs and Cautions when Designing Open-Source Software <span id="3-1-software-development-process-needs-and-cautions-when-designing-open-source-software"></span>

The key during the open-source requirements assessment phase is to confirm the agency’s business objectives and technical requirements. This is combined with a review of existing systems and resources to evaluate the functional suitability, security, community activity and maintenance capabilities of open-source options, as well as to analyze long-term costs and risks, ensuring that the selected open-source technologies or projects can achieve the expected outcomes of the initiative.

#### 3.1.1 Open-Source Software Evaluation and Type Selection Process <span id="3-1-1-open-source-software-evaluation-and-type-selection-process"></span>

The open-source software evaluation and selection process is mainly divided into five steps, which are explained one by one below. To ensure completeness in planning, agencies may refer to [Appendix IV](#appendix-iv-requirements-planning-self-assessment-checklist), “Self-Assessment Checklist for Public-Sector Project Adoption of Open-Source Software (or Public Code) Requirements Planning,” to conduct a self-review.

##### 1. Clarify requirements and identify project objectives and constraints

Confirm the core objectives of the project and plan the functions that the system requires in order to define specification requirements, ensuring support for the intended users and usage scenarios. At the same time, review whether there are regulatory or information-security policy constraints, such as personal data protection requirements or the applicability of internal organizational security standards to avoid risks arising during later adoption and to establish the basic conditions for selecting the type of software.

##### 2. Modularize requirements, replacing overdesign with extensible and participatory specifications

In information procurement management, overly detailed specifications are often set at an early stage, leading to overdesign. When dealing with projects that use open-source software or are intended to be released as open source, a better strategy is to divide overall requirements into several independently developable, replaceable, and freely composable “modules,” clearly defining the needs of each module.

This should be combined with participatory design involving multiple stakeholders, using collaborative discussions to determine more detailed functionalities.

The advantage of this approach is that individual modules can be upgraded or replaced in the future without affecting the entire system, greatly enhancing technical flexibility. The Ministry of Digital Affairs, for example, adopted a modular architecture when developing the Digital Wallet system, combined with diverse forms of civic participation and collaboration with technical communities, gradually refining its various future applications.

Requirements design should not be the product of closed-door meetings, but should instead be open to participation by diverse roles, including community developers, frontline operational staff, second-line administrative personnel and the public. The UK Government Digital Service (GDS), for instance, conducts extensive user research and prototype testing, iteratively refining designs to ensure that final products genuinely address public pain points. This is similar to many public infrastructure and cultural heritage restoration projects in Taiwan, where part of the professional effort involves participatory design or multi-stakeholder consultations that meaningfully influence project direction.

When designing the next-generation healthcare IT infrastructure, NHS Digital[^27] of the United Kingdom, did not build a massive monolithic system. Instead, it established a set of open API standards that allow

different service providers to connect in a modular manner, promoting market competition and innovation.

##### 3. Inventory potential open-source software and search for suitable projects

Collect open-source software options that meet project requirements and review factors such as community activity, maintenance frequency, version update status and license terms. For highly common functional requirements, agencies may prioritize evaluating the feasibility of adopting open-source software.

##### Common & Universal Functional Modules

| Fill out the form/upload the data | Case management | Map information display | Data retrieval | Data analysis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public service notification | Web performance detection | Automatic translation | Identity verification | Word processing |

##### 4. Component selection evaluation: three key checkpoints

When adopting external open-source components, the public sector should prioritize trustworthiness and maintainability. Although open-source components can rapidly improve development efficiency, a lack of evaluation and tracking may lead to licensing disputes or security risks. Therefore, it is recommended that every open-source component

incorporated into government projects follow open-source policy and pass the following three key checkpoints.

- License compatibility: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the component’s license terms, paying particular attention to “copyleft” licenses such as the GPL and whether they may conflict with other proprietary-licensed components in the project.
- Security: Review whether the component has any known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) and whether its maintenance team has a long-term and stable record of issuing security updates.
- Community health: A healthy community is key to whether a project can be maintained over the long term. Assess whether the project has active maintainers and contributors and whether the community’s discussion environment is friendly and open.

##### 5. Risk analysis: prevention is better than cure

Before adopting or developing any open-source system, risk assessment should be regarded as an integral part of the governance process rather than an after-the-fact remedy. Only by incorporating security and privacy considerations at the design stage can project operations remain stable over time and comply with regulatory requirements.

- Threat modeling: Potential attacks should be anticipated during the design phase with corresponding defense mechanisms planned in advance.
- Data design: Especially for architectures involving personally identifiable information, rigorous planning and encryption design must be carried out upfront to avoid architectural flaws that are difficult to remediate later.

Taking Estonia’s X-Road as an example, it uses a highly modular digital platform as the core of its e-government system. The platform itself does not store data; instead, it functions as a secure data-exchange layer that allows systems from different government agencies to securely access each other’s data based on authorization.

Building on the flexible foundation and open-source component selection established during the requirements and design phases, the development and testing stages must continue to uphold the open-source spirit. This includes making effective use of stakeholder resources and automated management mechanisms established earlier, in order to ensure the quality of open-source project development.

### 3.2 Software Development Process: Considerations for Open Source During Development and Testing <span id="3-2-software-development-process-considerations-for-open-source-during-development-and-testing"></span>

#### 3.2.1 Upstream First: Avoid “Fork Fatigue” <span id="3-2-1-upstream-first-avoid-fork-fatigue"></span>

The goal of a project is not merely “to make the functionality work,” but more importantly to “ensure that the results can be continuously maintained and are easy for the community to accept and contribute to.” The core principle at this stage is “Upstream First,” ensuring that localized modifications do not result in isolated “islands” detached from the mainstream version.

When modifying or adding functionality to open-source components, the first question should be: “Is this modification generally applicable? Can it be contributed back to the original (upstream) project?” Whenever possible, modifications should be contributed upstream rather than maintaining a local customized version. Long-term maintenance of an independent branch will inevitably lead to growing divergence from the upstream version, making upgrades increasingly difficult and eventually resulting in “fork fatigue.”

#### 3.2.2 Version Control and Automated Integration <span id="3-2-2-version-control-and-automated-integration"></span>

Introducing “automated governance” allows every code submission to be automatically inspected and verified, significantly reducing long-term maintenance risks and strengthening the foundation of trust for cross-departmental or cross-border collaboration. Version control and automated workflows are not merely technical management issues; they are governance tools that ensure project transparency, traceability, and sustainability, enabling future maintainers and audit bodies to clearly understand the system’s evolution.

The key points of version control and automated integration can be organized as follows:

- Version control: Use Git as the foundation for version control and adopt clear branching strategies and commit-message conventions so that every version difference is clearly traceable.
- SBOM and CI/CD integration: In continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) automated pipelines, include steps to automatically generate and inspect Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), ensuring that for every build, all dependency components are clearly identifiable.
- Automated compliance checks: During the testing phase, automated tools should be integrated concurrently to perform license scanning, compliance checks, and vulnerability scanning.
- Vulnerability patching and records: Establish standardized vulnerability patching processes and thoroughly track patching histories, ensuring that the maturity and security of the software foundation are transparent and verifiable.

When developing its national digital identity system, the German federal government extensively adopted GitLab’s automated testing and security scanning capabilities to ensure that every code submission meets stringent security requirements. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Energy requires open-source projects it funds to provide a complete SBOM prior to deployment and to pass automated compliance checks before formally entering the production stage, thereby institutionalizing supply-chain security.

##### Automated governance key points

| Key Point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Version control | Use Git as the foundation for version control and adopt clear branching strategies and commit-message conventions. |
| SBOM and CI/CD integration | Include steps to automatically generate and inspect Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). |
| Automated compliance checks | Perform license scanning, compliance checks, and vulnerability scanning. |
| Vulnerability patching and records | Establish standardized vulnerability patching processes and thoroughly track patching histories. |

System go-live is not the end of a project but the beginning of another governance cycle. Compared to traditional acceptance processes that merely verify whether functions meet specifications, greater emphasis should be placed on the project’s transferability. At this stage, the mindset must shift from “delivering a product” to “incubating a public asset.” The core questions in accepting an open-source project are: Can the project be easily understood, taken over and continued by other teams? And can we effectively avoid long-term lock-in to a single vendor’s proprietary technologies or knowledge barriers?

This section focuses on project acceptance criteria, emphasizing the project’s potential as a sustainable digital public infrastructure. Planning and execution at this stage will determine whether a publicly funded project ultimately becomes a truly public digital asset that can continuously evolve and be comprehensively reused or merely a one-off deliverable that quickly fades once the contract ends. We will examine three key acceptance priorities—transferability, readability, and sustainability—along with concrete and actionable guidelines.

### 3.3 Software Development Process: Open-Source Considerations for Go-Live and Acceptance <span id="3-3-software-development-process-open-source-considerations-for-go-live-and-acceptance"></span>

#### 3.3.1 Open-Source Software License Compliance Review (Checklist) and Risk Management Recommendations <span id="3-3-1-open-source-software-license-compliance-review-checklist-and-risk-management-recommendations"></span>

For open-source software adopted within a project, it is recommended to use the “License Compliance Assessment Checklist for Public-Sector Use of Open-Source Software (or Public Code)” as the review tool (see [Appendix V](#appendix-v-license-compliance-assessment-checklist), “License Compliance Assessment Checklist for Public-Sector Use of Open-Source Software (or Public Code)”). The checklist primarily includes three sections: basic project information, review items, and development outcomes as public code. It assists agencies in identifying risks associated with the use of open-source software and in planning appropriate risk-control measures.

Based on the results of the checklist, agencies should pay particular attention to the following items to strengthen the quality of risk control when using open-source software:

- License integration: When a system includes code licensed under different open-source licenses, attention must be paid to the requirements of each license. For example, when integrating GPL-licensed code with MIT- or Apache-licensed code, the resulting derivative work must comply with the GPL requirement that it “must also be licensed under the GPL”.
- Integration with proprietary software: Since the GPL mandates source-code disclosure, integrating GPL-licensed code into a closed-source system that provides external services without releasing the source code may constitute a license violation.
- Open-source release and maintenance after go-live: If a system is released as Public Code, appropriate resources should be planned to handle issues, continuously monitor community activity and establish version upgrade mechanisms and strategies (see Chapter 4 for details).

#### 3.3.2 The core of acceptance: Transferability, Readability and Sustainability <span id="3-3-2-the-core-of-acceptance-transferability-readability-and-sustainability"></span>

In the context of open-source projects, the focus of acceptance must go beyond functional conformance and deeply assess the project’s long-term health and autonomy. Transferability, readability and sustainability form the core of modern acceptance, ensuring that public investment generates long-term social value rather than being locked into short-term technical delivery. Key acceptance points are as follows:

##### Readable and complete technical documentation

Technical documentation is key to ensuring that project knowledge can be passed on and to avoiding “soft lock-in.” “Soft lock-in” means that even if the code is open source, the lack of clear documentation results in no team—other than the original developer—being able to effectively understand, maintain or extend the system. Therefore, during acceptance, documentation must be treated as a deliverable equally as important as the source code. This documentation should enable a technical team with no prior exposure to the project to complete the following tasks solely based on the documentation:

- Install all required dependency components
- Establish a development environment from scratch
- Install and compile the software
- Understand the overall architecture
- Deploy the software to the production environment

##### License Models That Allow Legal Modification and Reuse

Ensure that after the contract ends, the public sector retains full control and freedom of choice over the project. This involves multiple dimensions, including contracts, technical architecture and governance models. At the procurement contract level, ownership of intellectual property rights and licensing models should be clearly specified. Reference may be made to the “Information Services Procurement Guidelines” issued by Taiwan’s Public Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan, which recommends that agencies adopt a “license to use” approach that grants economic rights, facilitating subsequent system maintenance, management and functional enhancements. Key items should include:

- Reproduction rights
- Sublicensing rights

##### Preparation of the Final Deliverables Package

A complete and final compliance documentation package serves as the ultimate proof that a project has fulfilled its responsibilities in legal, security and supply-chain management. This is not merely a formal document submission but a concrete display of the project’s maturity and trustworthiness. At a minimum, this package should include:

- Information security risk assessment report
- License compliance report
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

#### 3.3.3 Aligning with International Standards: Assessing Project Completion Using the Public Code Standard Framework <span id="3-3-3-aligning-with-international-standards-assessing-project-completion-using-the-public-code-standard-framework"></span>

To make acceptance criteria more objective and internationally aligned, project managers may map the various deliverables described above to the specific provisions of the Standard for Public Code[^28] (SfPC). SfPC is a quality framework for open-source projects designed specifically for the public sector, with the goal of ensuring that Public Code is reusable, sustainable and capable of collaboration. Aligning acceptance items with SfPC not only enables a systematic evaluation of a project’s open-source maturity, but also demonstrates to domestic and international communities that the project adheres to global best practices.

The ultimate goal of adopting open source is to transform a single development outcome into a sustainably maintained “Public Code.” This is not merely the reuse of software assets, but an institutional commitment: all digital software/programs built with public funds should be designed so that they can be directly adopted and improved by other government agencies—or even communities in other countries. This approach maximizes the return of public investment, reduces resource waste caused by duplicate development and enhances cross-domain and cross-border collaboration efficiency.

This section explores how, from a governance perspective, a completed open-source project can be elevated into a Public Code asset with long-term value and impact.

### 3.4 Releasing Development Outcomes as Open Source <span id="3-4-releasing-development-outcomes-as-open-source"></span>

#### 3.4.1 Key Governance Considerations for Public Code <span id="3-4-1-key-governance-considerations-for-public-code"></span>

For a project to evolve from being merely “open-source” into “Public Code,” careful planning at the governance level is essential. This means that project quality, documentation, maintenance commitments, and community interaction models must all be assessed in terms of their future maintenance level and project positioning. Consideration must also be given to the completeness of documentation and file structures at the time of release, with the goal of fostering the broadest possible trust and collaboration.

##### Determining Different Public Code Maintenance Levels Based on Needs

| Does your project repository have more than one contributor? |
| --- |
| Does your project repository have plans to release new versions on an ongoing basis? |
| Does your project repository have contributors outside your organization or agency collaborating with you? |
| Do contributors outside your organization also participate in maintenance and operations? |
| Do contributors outside your organization also participate in setting future project goals? |

![Public Code maintenance-tier diagram using a tree-level metaphor to show archive-only, official long-term support, and community stewardship levels](assets/en-image25.png "Public Code maintenance tiers")

*Image source: The repo-scaffolder project under DSACMS in the United States*

Not all Public Code requires perpetual official maintenance by the government. A common misconception is that all open-source projects must remain permanently active. In reality, many unmaintained but still-used legacy projects become potential security risks. Therefore, in alignment with the acceptance phase, future maintenance levels must be clearly planned based on project importance, community activity and available resources.

| Maintenance Level | Applicable Scenarios | Governance Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 0–1: Source Code Archive Only | Projects that have completed their phase-based objectives and are no longer under active development. Examples include websites developed for one-time large-scale events or analysis tools used in completed research projects. These projects are highly unlikely to receive major future updates. Tier 0 may apply to projects with only a single contributor, while Tier 1 may apply when occasional future updates are possible. | Clearly mark the project as “Archived” in the README file and on the project website. Source code and documentation remain publicly available for reference, academic research, or reuse by others, but no official support, frequent updates, or security guarantees are provided. Nevertheless, such projects may still hold value for reference and reuse by other organizations. |
| Tier 2: Official Long-Term Support | Critical systems that support core public services and have high strategic importance, such as tax filing systems, digital identity services, or public warning systems. | The government allocates recurring budgets and forms dedicated internal teams or commissions professional vendors to carry out continuous development, maintenance, and security updates. This represents the highest level of commitment, ensuring system stability and reliability. |
| Tier 3–4: Community Stewardship | Highly practical tools or platforms that have formed active user or contributor communities but are not classified as critical infrastructure, such as data visualization tools, internal project management templates, or government website design systems. | The government’s role shifts from “lead developer” to “community enabler.” Instead of writing all code, the government provides essential infrastructure, establishes clear governance rules, and encourages community members to take on primary maintenance and development responsibilities. |

Making maintenance-tier decisions during project acceptance is a proactive risk-management strategy. Every government IT project should have a long-term strategic perspective and clearly define the scope of its long-term commitments. Publicly declaring a project as “archived” is not an admission of failure, but a responsible action that sets clear expectations and clarifies the government’s maintenance responsibilities.

#### 3.4.2 Establishing Clear and Friendly Community Contribution Processes <span id="3-4-2-establishing-clear-and-friendly-community-contribution-processes"></span>

Regardless of whether a project is Tier 1 or Tier 2, if it seeks to benefit from external community contributions, it must establish a clear, transparent and welcoming contribution process. This not only attracts valuable external contributions but also ensures that all incoming code meets quality and security standards. A sound community contribution mechanism should include the following elements:

##### Core governance documents

The code repository should include key governance documents to set clear codes of conduct and expectations for all participants.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | Provides detailed guidance on how to submit code contributions, such as how to open issues, how to submit pull requests, coding style requirements, and requirements for including tests. |
| CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | Defines a community code of conduct to ensure a respectful, inclusive, and professional collaborative environment. |
| GOVERNANCE.md | Describes the project’s decision-making processes, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the primary maintainers. |
| Issue tracking | All bug reports, feature proposals, and technical discussions should be conducted through a public issue-tracking system. |
| Code review | All code contributions must be reviewed by at least one maintainer to verify architectural soundness, coding style, and security standards before being merged into the main branch. |

#### 3.4.3 Active community support and engagement <span id="3-4-3-active-community-support-and-engagement"></span>

Building a successful community cannot rely solely on sitting and waiting for contributions. Instead, agencies should proactively provide multiple feedback channels (such as email and forums), encourage developers to share open-source examples of how they use the data and—where resources permit—regularly host events such as hackathons to actively engage with the developer community. In doing so, they will build an energetic ecosystem around open-source data. This proactive support is key to transforming “users” into “contributors.”

## Chapter 4: Open-Source Software Maintenance and Operations <span id="chapter-4-open-source-software-maintenance-and-operations"></span>

### 4.1 Open-Source Software Operations and Maintenance <span id="4-1-open-source-software-operations-and-maintenance"></span>

This chapter is recommended as priority reading for IT operations and maintenance personnel at all agencies.

Although open-source software may differ in technical architecture and tool choices, its post-deployment operations and maintenance share many core concepts with general information systems. However, source code maintenance often involves global community participation. Agencies or maintenance vendors therefore need to understand available resources and operating models and integrate them into practical O&M workflows. This chapter outlines seven key O&M work items, along with practical approaches and recommended tools for operating information systems built on open-source software.

| O&M Work Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| System Monitoring | Real-time tracking and analysis of system operation to ensure service and performance stability. |
| Log Management | Collect, store and analyze system logs for troubleshooting and audits. |
| Capacity Management | Forecast and adjust resource usage to prevent overloads or resource waste. |
| Information Security Management | Measures to protect systems and data from unauthorized access, attacks or leakage. |
| Functional Maintenance | Continuous bug fixes and system optimization to ensure stability and alignment with requirements. |
| Version Control | Management of change log to support collaboration and maintain version consistency. |
| Documentation Management | Maintenance of system documentation to ensure completeness, traceability and ease of reference. |

#### 4.1.1 System Monitoring <span id="4-1-1-system-monitoring"></span>

After a system goes live, its operational status must be monitored in real time to enable rapid response to anomalies. System monitoring includes continuous collection of metrics such as CPU usage, RAM usage, hard drive I/O and network traffic, as well as the configuration of alert thresholds—for example, automatically notifying O&M personnel when service response times exceed limits or error rates spike abnormally.

If an agency has no existing monitoring tools, it may consider adopting an open-source monitoring stack designed for cloud-native architectures, such as Prometheus paired with the visualization dashboard Grafana. Prometheus provides a powerful time-series database and query language (PromQL). Its core capabilities include data collection, time-series storage, alert rule configuration and flexible scalability. It also supports containerized environments such as Kubernetes and Docker—making it suitable for government agencies gradually adopting microservices architectures. Grafana is an open-source visualization tool commonly used with Prometheus to display monitoring data and build dashboards. It also supports multiple data sources, including Elasticsearch, MySQL, PostgreSQL and InfluxDB, making it well suited for integrating heterogeneous system data. Additionally, Grafana allows access control by user role, enabling layered internal management.

![Grafana monitoring dashboard screenshot with time-series charts, status indicators, and multiple monitoring panels](assets/en-image29.png "Grafana system monitoring dashboard")

#### 4.1.2 Log Management <span id="4-1-2-log-management"></span>

System logs record the historical events and operational traces of systems and applications. They are used for troubleshooting, security audits and behavior analysis. For example, information such as when users log in, API error responses or server anomalies is a core source of data for system operations and cybersecurity audits. Log management should centrally collect logs from the application layer, system layer and security events and enable visual analysis. Agencies should, in accordance with cybersecurity policies, define log retention periods and access controls and establish log-tracking procedures for abnormal events, ensuring that logs can be quickly located and investigated in cases of unauthorized access or system errors.

The key point of log management is to use centralized collection and structured formats to integrate logs distributed across nodes, support real-time search and analysis to quickly identify the source of problems, and retain necessary records for regulatory and audit requirements.

##### Four Key Areas for Log Management

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Structured logging | Use JSON or standardized formats to enable automated parsing and comparison by systems. |
| Centralized collection | Aggregate logs from different servers and services into a single platform to facilitate searching and analysis. |
| Compliance and auditing | Retain necessary log records to meet security and legal requirements (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001). |
| Real-time search and analysis | Quickly locate specific errors or patterns, such as sources of abnormal traffic. |

#### 4.1.3 Capacity Management <span id="4-1-3-capacity-management"></span>

The purpose of capacity management is to assess and tune system resources to ensure that they effectively support business needs while remaining flexible for future growth. The scope typically includes CPU, memory, storage and network bandwidth. Through continuous monitoring tools, operational metrics are collected and. By using historical data and statistical models, future resource demands are predicted to identify potential bottlenecks or risks. This enables resource optimization, capacity expansion planning or the introduction of automated scaling mechanisms (such as auto-scaling).

Compared to proprietary systems that often provide all-in-one capacity management solutions, open-source systems usually adopt a modular architecture, selecting and integrating multiple tools based on actual needs—for example, Prometheus and Grafana mentioned earlier. While this approach places higher demands on the technical team’s familiarity and integration capabilities, its flexibility allows agencies to rapidly adjust monitoring metrics and capacity strategies according to business requirements.

#### 4.1.4 Information Security Management <span id="4-1-4-information-security-management"></span>

Information security management refers to protecting system resources and data confidentiality, integrity and availability through a combination of policies, technologies and processes. Common measures include identity authentication, access control, data encryption, intrusion detection, firewall configuration, vulnerability scanning and log auditing. These measures prevent unauthorized access, malicious attacks and data breaches while ensuring that the system can detect, respond to and recover from security threats.

![Diagram summarizing information-security management elements including identity authentication, access control, data encryption, firewall configuration, intrusion detection, vulnerability management, and log auditing](assets/en-image33.png "Key elements of information security management")

#### 4.1.5 Functional Maintenance <span id="4-1-5-functional-maintenance"></span>

Functional maintenance of an information system refers to the ongoing inspection of existing system functions, bug fixes and feature optimization to ensure that the system operates stably and accurately supports business needs while continuously improving user experience. In addition, as business processes evolve and expand, system functionality must have the flexibility for adjustments and expansions to meet new requirements. Functional maintenance also bears responsibility for information security and compliance. Through regular updates and patches, it ensures that the system meets relevant regulations and security standards.

Since open-source software is typically community-driven, its functional maintenance does not rely on a single vendor but instead benefits from continuous involvement and improvement by developers worldwide. Issue trackers (such as GitHub Issues) allow developers to address feedbacks from the community, implement fixes, and submit updates. Under this model, agencies must regularly review community releases and security patches and publish them as needed and integrate third-party components or develop new features as needed.

##### Open-Source Software Issue Tracking and Resolution Workflow

| Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Create an issue | Users or developers submit issues in the project’s issue tracker. The issue should include a title, description, reproduction steps, expected results and actual results. |
| Categorization and labeling | Project maintainers label issues based on their nature (e.g., bug, question, security) and assign them to the relevant developers or teams. |
| Discussion and additional information | Developers and community members can comment under the issue to clarify details, provide reproduction methods or suggest solutions. |
| Fix and submit a PR | Developers fix the code based on the issue and submit a Pull Request (PR), typically linking it to the corresponding issue (e.g., Fixes #123). |
| PR review and merge | Maintainers review the PR to ensure correctness, merge it into the main branch, and close the related issue. |
| Release and documentation | The fix is included in the next release and recorded in the changelog for user reference. |

#### 4.1.6 Version Control <span id="4-1-6-version-control"></span>

The purpose of version control is to ensure system stability, traceability and consistency throughout ongoing maintenance. Effective version control enables agencies to clearly track the content, timing and impact of each system change and to quickly roll back to a stable version in case of anomalies, thereby reducing operational risk.

Version control covers multiple aspects, including source code management, system configuration records, database schema changes and API updates. Every new feature, bug fix or performance improvement should be recorded and managed with standardized naming conventions and version numbers. In practice, version control should be combined

with tools such as Git or SVN and continuous integration platforms (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI) to automatically record changes, run tests and deploy to testing or production environments. Before each release, comprehensive testing and acceptance should be conducted, followed by review and approval through change management processes to ensure version quality and system stability.

##### GitHub Version Control Process Diagram

![GitHub version-control process diagram with eight steps from creating an issue and branch through commit, push, pull request, code review, merge, and release](assets/en-image17.png "GitHub version-control process diagram")

1. Create a branch
2. Develop and commit
3. Push to GitHub
4. Create an issue
5. Create a PR
6. Code review
7. Merge PR
8. Tag and release version

#### 4.1.7 Documentation Management <span id="4-1-7-documentation-management"></span>

In the development and operation of information systems, documentation management is not only a medium for technical communication but also a critical foundation for quality control, knowledge transfer and compliance audits. Effective documentation management ensures consistency, traceability, and transparency in the development process, while reducing risks from personnel changes or system modifications.

Documentation management spans the entire system development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, system design, software development, testing and acceptance, deployment, and operational support. Documents such as requirement specifications, design diagrams, test plans, change logs and user manuals should all be included in a unified documentation management mechanism. Each document should have clear identifiers, version labels, authorship, and dates, be regularly reviewed and maintained and be organized according to standardized formats and naming conventions. Documentation should also be paired with version control tools and collaboration platforms to ensure that update histories are traceable, multi-party collaboration is supported and agency review and approval processes are properly enforced.

### 4.2 Sustainable Operations <span id="4-2-sustainable-operations"></span>

To support government agencies at all levels in effectively adopting and maintaining open-source systems over the long term, sustainable operations encompass five key areas: talent development, community engagement, technology upgrades, license compliance, and public contribution. These serve as reference pillars for agencies planning and executing open-source adoption, helping them establish a robust open-source governance framework and promoting innovation and sharing in government digital services.

##### Open-Source Software Sustainability Strategy

- Open-source talent development and culture building.
- Community activity monitoring and continuous integration.
- Establishing system management and upgrade strategies.
- License management and code reuse.
- Connecting communities and public code platforms.

#### 4.2.1 Open-Source talent development and culture building <span id="4-2-1-open-source-talent-development-and-culture-building"></span>

The sustainable promotion of open-source software begins with establishing a solid talent pool and an open and open-source-oriented development culture. This includes government staff and partner vendors’ understanding of open-source fundamentals, license comprehension, hands-on experience and an open mindset.

To this end, the Ministry of Digital Affairs will continue to offer related training programs each year, covering open-source technical architectures, community participation, license compliance, and operational practices. Currently, eight public-code-related courses are available on the “e-Learning for Civil Servants+” platform, which agencies are encouraged to leverage to gradually build open-source adoption and management capabilities.

| Basic Public Code Courses 101 | Basic Public Code Courses 102 | Basic Public Code Courses 103 | Basic Public Code Courses 104 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Global trends and ecosystems of open source. | From open source to public code: concept introduction. | From open source to public code: benefits and daily applications. | Basic standards and elements of software management. |
| Advanced Public Code Courses 201 | Advanced Public Code Courses 202 | Advanced Public Code Courses 203 | Advanced Public Code Courses 204 |
| International public code case studies and policies. | Domestic public-code and open-source case studies. | Introduction to public-code procurement documents: requirement assessment and license terms. | International standards for public-code vendor management. |

#### 4.2.2 Community Activity Monitoring and Continuous Integration <span id="4-2-2-community-activity-monitoring-and-continuous-integration"></span>

The vitality of open-source software comes from active communities. Regularly reviewing community announcements, security patches, and feature expansions of adopted open-source projects is critical to maintaining system security and stability. Open-source communities typically communicate and collaborate through platforms such as

GitHub, GitLab, forums, mailing lists or instant-messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord). These platforms serve not only as channels for bug reporting and issue tracking but also as key sources for feature proposals and version planning.

By continuously monitoring these community activities, agencies can promptly identify potential security risks and technology trends and take timely countermeasures, avoiding exposure from outdated or vulnerable versions.

Beyond passive notification reception, agencies using open-source software should establish routine tracking mechanisms to monitor version updates and synchronize or upgrade versions as needed. These mechanisms can be paired with automated tools to regularly check dependency updates and use CI pipelines for testing and validation, ensuring that upgrades do not affect existing functionality and will improve overall operational stability and flexibility.

#### 4.2.3 Establishing System Management and Upgrade Strategies <span id="4-2-3-establishing-system-management-and-upgrade-strategies"></span>

Before deploying new versions, agencies should comprehensively review their compatibility with existing system architectures, database schemas, API interfaces and third-party components. If incompatibilities are found, agencies may leverage the modifiable nature of open-source software to implement code fixes and adjustments independently, without waiting for upstream releases. This self-maintenance capability is one of the strengths of open source and requires corresponding technical capacity building and collaboration mechanisms.

Upgrade strategies should follow the principle of “controlled risk and stable functionality,” supported by tools and automated testing frameworks to ensure each upgrade is thoroughly tested and can be quickly rolled back. Particular caution is required for critical components (such as databases and authentication systems) to avoid dependency conflicts. Regular reviews of project maintenance status and community activity also help assess whether agencies should continue use this project or should consider other alternatives.

#### 4.2.4 License Management and Code Reuse <span id="4-2-4-license-management-and-code-reuse"></span>

License management is a critical aspect of information system governance as different open-source licenses impose varying rights and obligations regarding use, modification, distribution and commercialization. Improper management may result in legal or compliance risks, especially when an agency is integrating open-source components and therefore must pay extra attention to license compatibility and obligations.

It is therefore recommended to establish a license management mechanism that includes: adoption of open-source license scanning tools (e.g., FOSSA), establishment of component review processes and regular license compliance audits. When reusing or further developing source code, agencies should carefully examine the original license terms to determine whether the same license must be applied, whether source code disclosure is required and the appropriate disclosure scope. This process affects not only legal compliance but also future system openness and reusability.

Through these measures, agencies can enjoy the flexibility and innovation benefits of open source while reducing legal risks and ensuring all components meet organizational compliance and security requirements.

#### 4.2.5 Connecting Communities and Public Code Platforms <span id="4-2-5-connecting-communities-and-public-code-platforms"></span>

“Walking alone is fast; walking together goes far.” To promote a positive open-source ecosystem cycle, agencies should consider contributing results back to upstream communities or publishing them on government public-code platforms after major feature development or fixes. This demonstrates governmental support for open-source principles, enhances technical transparency and public participation and further strengthens the foundation for sustainable open-source development.

### 4.3 Conclusion <span id="4-3-conclusion"></span>

The adoption and development of open-source software have become mainstream practices in information-software work. Internationally, many public-sector organizations have invested heavily in the development and application of open-source software in order to build globally shared digital public goods or strengthen digital sovereignty. They have also gradually established best practices for open-source governance systems, ensuring open-source license compliance, emphasizing information security and privacy, and taking operational efficiency and sustainability into account.

The adoption of open-source software and Public Code is not merely a technical choice, but also a transformation of government digital governance and an important milestone toward open government. Chapters 1 and 2 of this manual introduce the basic concepts of open-source software and explain its practical applications across multiple public sectors internationally, supplemented by recommendations on risk assessment, benefits of use, and open-source software governance systems. These chapters help agencies gradually develop a clear understanding of the meaning, value, and management methods of open-source software before launching related projects. Chapters 3 and 4 then follow the stages of open-source software adoption, from requirements and design, development and testing, go-live and acceptance, to operations and sustainable management, explaining matters requiring attention at each stage. They also provide two tools, the Requirements Planning Self-Assessment Checklist and the License Compliance Assessment Checklist, to help agencies implement open-source software in practice.

Through the international application cases, evaluation methods, adoption processes for open-source software and Public Code, and the management priorities and sustainability strategies for maintaining open-source software compiled in this manual, we hope to help agencies promote open-source applications while balancing technical benefits with the sustainable value created after license compliance. Furthermore, guided by this manual, agencies in Taiwan can strengthen their capacity to adopt open-source software, promote the release of common open-source components by the government, connect with the latest international public-sector trends in open-source software application, and jointly build a secure, resilient and shared digital public environment.

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Public Code | Software code developed or procured by government agencies that is released in the form of open-source code. |
| 2 | Open Source | Code that is made publicly available and allows others to use, copy, modify, distribute and share the technology for commercial or non-commercial purposes. |
| 3 | Open-Source Software, OSS | Software whose source code is publicly available and allows others to use, copy, modify, distribute, and share the technology. Such software is governed by specific open-source license terms, ensuring that users enjoy the freedom to use it while complying with the license conditions. |
| 4 | Open Source License | Licenses used by open-source software that comply with international standards and are recognized by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), including provisions governing copyright, reproduction rights and other matters. |
| 5 | Proprietary Software | Software whose intellectual property rights are exclusively owned by a specific individual or organization. |

## Appendix II: FAQ <span id="appendix-ii-faq"></span>

Since 2023, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has organized seminars and related activities to introduce and exchange ideas on the concept of Public Code and its adoption by the public sector. The table below includes frequently-asked questions and their responses from these seminars based on the real-world experience shared in these activities.

| No. | Question | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Will making software source code public create cybersecurity risks? | Public Code only opens the system’s source code architecture, not the content data. Moreover, because the code can be publicly reviewed, vulnerabilities can be identified by more people when they arise and even poorly written or inefficient code from earlier development stages can be improved. Security depends on maintenance mechanisms and usage practices, not on whether the code is open source. |
| 2 | How is using open-source software or Public Code different from conventional information system development? | In traditional information system development, requirements are usually defined from scratch and systems are developed accordingly. By contrast, using open-source software or Public Code allows customization based on systems whose requirements and development have already been completed, reducing duplicated development effort. |
| 3 | Are other developed countries’ governments also promoting Public Code? | Many countries are actively promoting Public Code policies, treating government-developed information and communication systems’ source code as public assets and making them open for public use. For example, Estonia, Finland and Iceland jointly maintain the open-source X-Road system, allowing governments to freely use it domestically and submit fixes when issues are discovered so that other entities can update simultaneously. The United Kingdom has also modularized internal government form-design and submission mechanisms into independent services that can be shared not only across UK government agencies but also applied for by other countries’ governments. |
| 4 | If an organization wishes to use open-source software or Public Code, which system development vendors are available? | Any vendor that complies with the relevant open-source license requirements may customize and maintain Public Code, expanding opportunities for government agencies to collaborate with a wider range of vendors. |
| 5 | In procurement processes, how can vendors be required to reuse Public Code or release development outcomes as Public Code? | Tender documents may specify that development outcomes (or parts thereof) must reuse or reference designated Public Code projects, clearly define the software licensing terms, or include vendors’ past open-source or Public Code contributions and development experience as evaluation criteria. |
| 6 | Can open-source software be integrated with existing commercial systems? | Most open-source software supports standard formats and APIs and can be integrated with commercial systems. |
| 7 | What should IT vendors undertaking government projects be aware of when reusing Public Code? | Each Public Code project may use a different open-source license, so it is necessary to understand in advance whether the license has specific requirements. For example, the Apache 2.0 license requires that reused code include attribution and a NOTICE file. In addition, although Public Code complies with security standards, the responsibility for the security of systems developed using reused Public Code still lies with the system development vendor. |
| 8 | How should open-source software and third-party components in an information environment be managed? | SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) scanning tools can be used to establish an inventory of all components in use, including versions, sources, and licensing information. This helps agencies with vulnerability tracking, compliance reviews and supply-chain security management. |
| 9 | How are responsibilities defined when using Public Code? | The open-source licenses used by Public Code typically include disclaimers. This means that government agencies and IT vendors reusing Public Code remain responsible for the information security, copyright and operation of the systems they develop. |
| 10 | How are projects on the Public Code platform maintained? | During the period when Public Code is open to the public, in addition to the government agency that provides the code, others may also submit code modification proposals through the code repository (e.g., GitHub) as part of civic participation in the realm of code. |

## Appendix IV: Requirements Planning Self-Assessment Checklist <span id="appendix-iv-requirements-planning-self-assessment-checklist"></span>

### Self-Assessment Checklist for Public-Sector Projects Introducing Open-Source Software or Public Code

This self-assessment checklist is designed to assist public-sector IT project officers when introducing open-source software or public code. It can be used during the project formulation stage or while drafting the “Requirements Specification” to conduct an initial self-review. The purpose is to help clarify considerations for subsequent project implementation, enabling a smoother, step-by-step integration of open-source concepts and compliance governance together with cooperating vendors.

IT project officers may, based on their agency’s needs, refer to the assessment items for each stage and evaluate the level of adoption with reference to the “Benefits to the Agency.” They may also consult the concrete implementation recommendations to adjust or review their requirements specification, thereby progressively putting open-source practices into action.
